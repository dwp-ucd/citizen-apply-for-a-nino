  <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should only apply for a National Insurance number if the Department
      for Work and Pensions (DWP) or the Department for Communities (DfC) told
      you to do so.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Find your identity documents</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you have the following documents, get them ready before you start:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a passport from any country</li>
      <li>a biometric residence permit (BRP)</li>
      <li>
        a national identity card from an EU country or from Norway,
        Liechtenstein or Switzerland
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may need to enter information from one or more of these documents â€“
      for example, your passport number and your BRP number, if you have these.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you do not have any of these identity documents, you can still apply
      online for a National Insurance number. However, you will need to prove
      your identity in a different way, which will take longer. We will contact
      you after you have applied to tell you what to do.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prepare to take digital photos</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You may need to take digital photographs of your documents and of
      yourself, and upload these as part of your application. Do not take these
      photographs yet: we will explain what you need to do.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you have a smartphone, tablet or a digital camera, make sure these are
      charged and working before you start.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you cannot upload photos, you can still apply online for a National
      Insurance number. However, you will need to prove your identity in a
      different way, which will take longer. We will contact you after you have
      applied to tell you what you need to do.
