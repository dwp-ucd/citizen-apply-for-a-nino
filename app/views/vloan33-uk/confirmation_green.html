        When you speak to us, you will need to give us this reference number:

    <br />

    <p>
      This is the reference number for your application. Make a note of it and
      keep it safe. This is not your National Insurance number.

    <br />
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If we approve your application, we will send you a National Insurance
      number within 4 weeks of your appointment.

    <br />

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can start work and get paid without a National Insurance number if you
      can prove you can work in the UK. Your employer might ask for proof of
      your right to work in the UK.
