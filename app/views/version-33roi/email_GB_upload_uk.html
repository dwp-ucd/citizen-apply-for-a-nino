      We are working hard to process applications that have been delayed because
      of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We will review your application as
      soon as we can.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can start work and get paid without a National Insurance number if you
      can prove you can work in the UK. Your employer might ask for proof of
      your right to work in the UK.
